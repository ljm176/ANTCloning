# Automated Natural Transformation (ANT) using A. Bayli

## Description
This repository contains the code for operation of the Opentrons OT2 robot described in the publication *Automated Cloning by Natural Transformation* by Jiang et al. (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00240)

There are four steps in the workflow performed in the robot: 

1. PCR Setup
2. Dilution and dpn1 digestion
3. OE-PCR setup
4. Transformation
5. Plating

There is a jupyter notebook available for simulating the protocols to more easily track the actions the robot will take for each protocol.
